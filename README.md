## 📌 About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://iili.io/3mCdMuV.md.jpg)

NICMUN 2025 is a fully responsive and interactive website designed for a two-day MUN conference. It allows students to:

- Explore committees and agendas
- Register and find their assignments
- Access downloadable guides and conference resources
- View a live schedule and student portal

This project demonstrates my front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and reflects real-world web development structure.
